# Babel

# ES6 constructs

## Use let

## Constants const pi = 3.14

## Array destructuring
### let numbers = [1,2,3,4]; let [x, y] = numbers;

## Rest Operator
### let [x, y, ...z ] = numbers;

## Spread Operator: Both arrays and Objects
### let newNumbers = [...numbers, 10, 20, 30]
### add(...numbers)
### let newObject = { ...emp, newProperty: 1 }

## Default Values for function arguments

## Arrow Functions
### Function as function expression instead of statement.
### var add = (x, y) => { 
  console.log(First statement);
  return x + y;
 }
### var add = (x, y) => x + y;

### Array Methods
#### filter
#### map
#### reduce
#### forEach

## Template Strings
### You can use template variables using ` before a variable.

## Class
### class Employee {
  constructor: function(id) {
    this.id = id;
  }
}

## Inheritance
### class FTE extends Employee {
	consturct: function(id, benfits) {
	  super(id);
	  this.benfits = benefits;
	}
}

From Saurabh
Babel.js(transpiler) -> transpiles esx to es5


ESX Features:

1. Variable Declarations (Is js we do it using var, but here the variable is not block scope, there for for(var i) declares i for the rest of the code)
 Issue: Variable Hoisting

Declare a variable using let makes it block scoped. Therefore, only use let, and hence, better than var declaration.

2. Consts are same

3. Array dereferencing
var numbers = [2,5,7,4,9]
var [x, y] = numbers
O/P: x=2, y=5
No need to use temp variables to swap
[x,y] = [y,x]

4. Rest Operator (LHS) / Spread Operator(RHS)
[x,y,...z] = numbers
z = (Array containing remaining values) 

var numbers = [2,5,7,4,9]
undefined
var [x,y, ...z] = numbers
undefined
z
(3) [7, 4, 9]
var newNumbers = [...numbers,10,20,30]
undefined
newNumbers
(8) [2, 5, 7, 4, 9, 10, 20, 30]
﻿
5. Default Operators (Same as python)

​6. Arrow Functions
var add = (x,y) => { return x+y; }
add(1,2)
3

var staionaryProducts = products.filter(function(product){return product.vategory == 'stationary'})
console.table(stationaryProducts)

Study 4 methods of an array:
a. Filter
b. Map
c. Reduce
d. forEach

7. Template strings

var s= `Value of x is ${x} and value of y is ${y}`
undefined
s
"Value of x is 10 and value of y is 20"

You can use template variables within backquotes(below ESC key)

8. Classes

class Employee {
	constructor(id,name,salary){
		this.id=id;
		this.name=name;
    }
	display(){
		console.log(`id = ${this.id}`)
    }
}
VM112:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'Employee' has already been declared
    at <anonymous>:1:1
typeof Employee
"function"

Its still a function

http://es6-features.org (Its a good website!!)



Notes: typeof command gives the type of any created variable. Read about creating refs in React. Refs are used as hook to elements in VDOM
Class level variables have to be defined without let
Let is only for local variables

diff bw js and jsx:

class changes to className is JSX
for changes to htmlFor
every tag has to be a closed tag
React component is a view
